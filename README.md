Here are explanations for some of the key SQL queries in the provided SQL code:

1. The senior most employee query selects the employee with the highest "levels" value, which seems to indicate seniority level. It orders the employees by descending levels and limits to the top result.

2. The countries with most invoices query groups the invoices by billing country, counts the invoices per country, and orders by the maximum invoice count descending to show the countries with the most invoices.

3. The top 3 invoice totals query simply selects the total value from the invoices table, orders by total descending, and limits to the top 3 results to get the invoices with the 3 highest totals.

4. The best customer city query groups the invoices by billing city, sums the totals per city, orders by the sum descending, and limits to one record to get the city with the overall highest total invoice sum.

5. The best customer query joins customers and invoices, groups by customer ID and names, sums the invoice totals per customer, orders by total descending, and limits to one record to get the single customer with the highest total purchase amount. 

6. The distinct customers query joins the customer, invoice, and invoice_line tables to get the customer contact info for anyone with invoices and invoice lines (i.e. customers who actually made purchases).  The distinct limits duplicate records.

7. The top rock artists query counts tracks per artist for the rock genre, orders by descending track count, and limits to 5 records to get the 5 artists with the most rock tracks.

8. The longest tracks query selects tracks longer than the average track length and orders them by descending duration to list the longest tracks first.
